# Techno-Economic Evaluation of Telecommunication Systems - Assignment Part 2

This repository contains the files and information related to Part 2 of the assignment for the course "Techno-Economic Evaluation of Telecommunication Systems" for the academic year 2022-2023.



## Description


### S-curve Demand Modeling and Forecasting
1. Perform parameter estimation using the Fisher-Pry, Gompertz, and Linear Logistic S-curve models to model demand based on historic data.
2. Forecast future demand until the year 2030 using the above-mentioned models.
3. Compare the models using statistical measures such as MSE, MAE, and MAPE to determine which model best captures future demand.
4. Provide comments on the returns, performance, and changes in the diffusion of telecom services for each model.

### Volatility Modeling and RiskMetrics Application
1. Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test on the demand data.
2. Estimate the drift (μ) and volatility (σ) parameters to model the data as a Geometric Brownian Motion.
3. Apply the RiskMetrics technique (Monte Carlo Simulation - 10,000 sampling) to estimate future demand dispersion until the years 2025 and 2030.
4. Estimate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) for the lower 25% of cases.
5. Provide comments on the findings compared to S-curve modeling.

## Deliverables
- A PDF document containing all the required analysis.
- An Excel file containing all the data, calculations, graphs, and any other necessary information.

## Data Sources
All data sources used for the assignment should be well-documented.

## Presentation
The findings from Part 2, along with the telecom demand evolution data collected in Part 1, will be presented in class. The presentation should be in PowerPoint format and have a maximum duration of 15 minutes.

## Software and Tools
Demand modeling and forecasting can be performed using any logistic-capable software package such as MS Excel, Statgraphics, Minitab, Datafit, Matlab, or equivalent. For Monte Carlo Simulation, dedicated software like Oracle Crystal Ball or any SDE for technical computing capability (e.g., Matlab) can be used.

If you encounter any difficulties in finding or accessing the required software applications, please reach out to the teaching team for assistance.
